<h1 style="color:red"> PERSONAL INFORMATION </h1>
<p>
My name is Phan Hoai Vu, my student ID is s3741024, I am live in Viet Nam and I speak Vietnamese. 
I don't follow any religion, so my whole family goes to both the temple and the church. 
I really like listening to music and playing games in my free time. 
I'm accumulating dogs and cats, but since I'm at the inn, it's not easy to raise them. 
I'm the type of person who is comfortable with people, I don't have much sense of humor but people can feel comfortable playing with me.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red"> INTEREST IN IT </h1>
<p>
My interest in IT is probably understanding how games are created and developed over time. 
I became interested in IT after the university exam. 
I was not interested in IT through any event, maybe it was my friend, he introduced me to how the game works and the publishers developed it. I still don't have much experience in IT because 
I am just starting to learn it and it will probably take me a lot of time to understand it.
</p>

<p>
I chose RMIT because it is a technology school and using English to communicate will help my English proficiency improve a lot in English. 
At RMIT, there is much needed equipment to help students easily understand the lesson.
</p>

<p>
I look forward to this course will be able to help me better understand IT and what it takes to be able to continue on other areas of IT in the future. 
I hope I can learn more in this course and in the following courses.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red"> IDEAL JOB </h1>
<p>
Participate in developing functions for the game to perfect it for all players from many countries around the world. 
Working concentrated in a few places to be able to develop the game according to the player's wishes. 
Have the opportunity to prove your ability in the profession and challenge yourself with your ability. 
What makes it appealing to me is the challenge I will face when I work in this position and the opportunity to improve myself.
</p>

<p>
the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position are that we must have extensive knowledge of the game for 5 years or more and apply software engineering. 
We need to master programming knowledge, from beginner to advanced, to have advanced skills to solve common problems with software, programming and application design. 
Attitude, we need to be passionate about work, flexible, can have a teamwork spirit as well as individuals.

After doing the tests I found that it would not affect my personality much but it also brought a new perspective to me. These tests will not affect my teamwork, I will still try to help everyone on the team and fulfill the assigned role in the group.

<h1 style="color:red"> PROJECT IDEA </h1>
<p>
Basically, this project is implemented based on the fact that the sensors through the water level to warn of flash floods are still expensive, such as 52202-10-L/52203. - L Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge is priced at more than $600. Therefore, this paper focuses on the use of Arduino circuits and other low-cost devices to build a similar system to implement mass forecasting models for low-income countries which are inability to use existing market alert system.
  </p>
<p>
  According to ADB (2017), flooding is one of the most killing natural disasters in the world. For example, in 2004, the most devastating tsunami killed 280,000 people in 15 countries after an earthquake in Sumatra island of Indonesia. Additionally, the number of people missing from flash summer flood in the Changjiang River in China in 1931 is believed to be more than millions of lives, although the official number has been reduced (Chinvanno & Jintrawet, 2008). Furthermore, in Myanmar in 2019, about 80,000 people have no permanent residence every year and have to relocate due to floods, while the number of deaths due to flash floods every year is difficult to statistic.
  </p>
<p>
  The main and most important cause of flash floods and landslides is due to heavy rainfall, concentrated in a short time. Thus, in order to predict flash floods and landslides, it is extremely important to calculate the amount of rainfall and the amount of water concentrated on rivers and streams.
It consists of 2 independent devices. The first is a flood meter, it uses solar energy, the sensor will measure the water level on the rivers and streams, then transmit data to the home page, and will issue a warning signal to the authorities. clearance of GSM technology when it exceeds the safety threshold. The second device is responsible for measuring rain water in real time, it will alert immediately when the amount of water exceeds the safety threshold by a warning horn at the position where the device is usually located in residential areas. In the rain gauge, it includes components such as sensors, power and battery packs, microcontrollers, and sirens.
Rain measuring device will have 2 different working modes. Mode 1 when the power is available, the device will use power directly from the power source such as sun while the battery will be charged. In contrast, in mode 2, when a power shortage which is very common in the rain, the device will use the electricity accumulated in Lithium 6000 mAh for short period until the sun power system can be used again. The sensor will provide data for the amount of water present in the rain gauge bucket. The AVR microcontroller then has the task of calculating the amount of water over time and deciding whether to give a warning or not (Intharasombat & Khoenkaw, 2015).

<p>
  In designing, except for the skill of using C-based Arduino IDE software to program hardware, it also requires the person to have knowledge of algorithm of rainfall system, such as using Use the lowest rainfall, the intensity and the actual water level to determine the warning threshold. Besides, it also requires practical circuit making skills, such as drawing printed circuits and installing equipment. Particularly, it also needs the skills of researching and collecting actual data of each installation site to maximize the accuracy of the warning set based on the topography of each region.
While IDE software is provided free of charge, the hardware can also be easily purchased on the market through e-commerce sites like Amazon or AliExpress. The difficulty, however, is that there is sufficient knowledge of complete system design, such as C language learning and circuit drawing. However, this knowledge can be found easily on the internet, for example through websites like blog.arduino.cc or GitHub.

<p>
  Flood warning system costs less than $50 (Appendix) with a total capacity of about 98mW and can work continuously for 13.5 days in the absence of sunlight.
