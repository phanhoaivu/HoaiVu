<p>
My name is Phan Hoai Vu, my student ID is s3741024, I am live in Viet Nam and I speak Vietnamese. 
I don't follow any religion, so my whole family goes to both the temple and the church. 
I really like listening to music and playing games in my free time. 
I'm accumulating dogs and cats, but since I'm at the inn, it's not easy to raise them. 
I'm the type of person who is comfortable with people, I don't have much sense of humor but people can feel comfortable playing with me.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red"> INTEREST IN IT </h1>
<p>
My interest in IT is probably understanding how games are created and developed over time. 
I became interested in IT after the university exam. 
I was not interested in IT through any event, maybe it was my friend, he introduced me to how the game works and the publishers developed it. I still don't have much experience in IT because 
I am just starting to learn it and it will probably take me a lot of time to understand it.
</p>

<p>
I chose RMIT because it is a technology school and using English to communicate will help my English proficiency improve a lot in English. 
At RMIT, there is much needed equipment to help students easily understand the lesson.
</p>

<p>
I look forward to this course will be able to help me better understand IT and what it takes to be able to continue on other areas of IT in the future. 
I hope I can learn more in this course and in the following courses.
</p>
